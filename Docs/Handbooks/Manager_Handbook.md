# Manager Handbook

## Overview
Welcome to the Manager Dashboard and toolkit. This handbook provides comprehensive guidance for using the Lyra adaptive learning system and managing team performance effectively.

## Lyra Adaptive Learning System

### Overview
Lyra is an intelligent system that learns from user behavior patterns and adapts the interface to optimize workflow efficiency. The system tracks user interactions and progressively reduces guidance as competency increases.

### User Performance Levels

#### Beginner
- **Characteristics**: New to the system, requires guidance and tips
- **System Response**: Full tooltips, step-by-step guidance, confirmation dialogs
- **Duration**: Typically first 1-2 weeks of system usage

#### Intermediate  
- **Characteristics**: Familiar with basic workflows, developing muscle memory
- **System Response**: Reduced tooltips, contextual hints only for complex tasks
- **Duration**: 2-8 weeks of regular usage
- **Criteria**: 3+ successful completions of core workflows

#### Expert
- **Characteristics**: Proficient users with established workflow patterns
- **System Response**: Minimal interface, advanced shortcuts enabled
- **Special Features**: Mentor Mode toggle becomes available
- **Criteria**: Consistent task completion patterns, minimal errors

### Mentor Mode

Expert-level users can enable Mentor Mode to:
- Guide newer team members through complex workflows
- Share best practices and shortcuts
- Provide contextual assistance during training sessions
- Access advanced analytics and team performance insights

## Team Performance Analytics

### User Behavior Tracking
The system monitors:
- Task completion frequency
- Workflow patterns and sequences
- Time spent on different activities
- Error rates and recovery patterns
- Help-seeking behaviors

### Performance Insights
- Individual skill progression tracking
- Team efficiency benchmarks
- Workflow optimization opportunities
- Training needs identification

## Managing Tips and Guidance

### Tip Suppression
- Users can suppress specific tips after demonstrating competency
- System automatically reduces tip frequency based on usage patterns
- Managers can override tip settings for training purposes

### Customization Options
- Adjust tip frequency thresholds
- Configure muscle memory detection sensitivity
- Set team-specific workflow preferences
- Customize guidance content for organizational needs

## Best Practices

### For New Team Members
1. Allow full guidance during initial training period
2. Monitor progression through performance levels
3. Encourage exploration of system features
4. Schedule regular check-ins during intermediate phase

### For Experienced Users
1. Enable advanced features and shortcuts
2. Consider Mentor Mode activation for senior staff
3. Use performance analytics to identify optimization opportunities
4. Provide feedback on system adaptations

### Team Management
1. Review team performance analytics regularly
2. Identify users who may benefit from additional training
3. Leverage expert users as mentors for newer team members
4. Customize system settings based on team workflow patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Tips not adapting**: Check user interaction logs and performance level classification
- **Mentor Mode unavailable**: Verify user has reached Expert level status
- **Performance data missing**: Ensure tracking services are enabled

### Support Resources
- Contact system administrator for advanced configuration
- Review user interaction logs for detailed behavior analysis
- Access team performance reports through the dashboard
